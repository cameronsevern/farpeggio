# Farpeggio

A simple webpage that records a sound and plays it back as an arpeggio. You can select a chord, number of octaves, pattern, and tempo. A sample sound is included in the `sounds` folder that you can try from the **Sample** dropdown and play with the **Play Sample** button.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (mobile friendly) or host the repo on GitHub Pages.

## Deployment on GitHub Pages
1. Commit the files to a repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, using the `main` branch (or whichever branch contains `index.html`).
3. Visit the provided GitHub Pages URL to use the app.

No build steps are required because all files are static.
